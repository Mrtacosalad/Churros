        <h2>Costco’s Churro Blunder</h2>
        <p>Costco may be known for its epic snacks, but removing churros from the menu was a mistake. Even though they weren’t the best churros, they had a special place in every Costco-goer’s heart. Replacing them with a chocolate chip cookie? Sacrilege!</p>

        <h2>The Churro Experience</h2>
        <p>What makes churros truly special is their versatility. They can be enjoyed plain or filled with chocolate, caramel, or even fruit. And let’s not forget how perfectly they pair with a warm cup of coffee or hot chocolate. Churros are a snack that brings people together, one sugary bite at a time.</p>
